I am a software engineer (backend) at [Mceasy](https://www.mceasy.com/), currently working on [Video Monitoring](https://www.mceasy.com/solusi/video-monitoring/) and [Report and Analytic](https://www.mceasy.com/solusi/report-and-analytics/). I have a passion for crafting rock-solid, scalable software that doesn't just work â€“ it thrives. Equipped with a diverse skill set and a quick learning curve, I can adapt swiftly to new technologies to tackle complex challenges head-on. When not architecting efficient systems, I explores the DevOps and Linux landscape.

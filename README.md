I'm a software engineer(Backend) with a knack for crafting rock-solid, scalable software that doesn't just work â€“ it thrives. Equipped with a diverse skill set and a quick learning curve, I adapt swiftly to new technologies to tackle complex challenges head-on. Currently wielding Golang and Node.js as my primary tools, I craft efficient and powerful backend systems. When I'm not architecting efficient systems, I'm exploring the DevOps and Linux landscape.
